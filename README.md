# Student Grade Calculator
A Python program that collects student names and test scores, calculates letter grades, and displays a formatted grade report.  
The program also identifies the highest score among all students and assigns grades relative to that score.

## About the Project
This project demonstrates working with Python **functions, lists, loops, and conditionals** to process multiple inputs and produce a structured output.  
The program validates user input and ensures scores and student numbers are within reasonable ranges.

The code for this project is included in the attached Python file (StudentGradeCalculator.py) and can be run directly to see these concepts in action.

## Skills Practiced
- Python **input handling** and **validation**  
- **Lists** to store student names, scores, and grades  
- **Functions** for modular programming  
- **Loops** (for loops) for processing multiple students  
- **Conditional statements** (if, elif, else) for letter grade assignment  
- **Formatted output** with format()
